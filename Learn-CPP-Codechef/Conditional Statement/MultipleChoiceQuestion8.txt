#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = -10;

    if (a >= b) cout << "a is greater or equal to b. ";
    if ((a == 0) || (b == 0)) cout << "At least one is 0. ";
    if ((a == 0) && (b == 0)) cout << "Both are 0. ";
    cout << "Program ends";
}
