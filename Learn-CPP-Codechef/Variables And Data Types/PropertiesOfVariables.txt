There is some code written in the editor to print the number 8. But the variable name is not following the rule. Can you spot the mistake and fix it?



            <------------ Before ------------>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Fix the variable name to make the code work

    int 1st_number = 8;
    cout<<1st_number<<endl;

}
            <------------ After ------------>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Fix the variable name to make the code work

    int number = 8;
    cout<<number<<endl;

}
