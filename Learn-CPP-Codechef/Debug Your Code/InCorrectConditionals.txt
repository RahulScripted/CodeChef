Incorrect conditionals are one of the most common types of logical errors, which can be seen while using conditional statements like if-else and loops.



        <--------- Given Code ----------->

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    if(n<5)
    {
        cout<<"the number is greater than 5";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"the number is smaller than or equal to 5";
    }    
}

        <--------- Right Code ----------->

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    if(n<=5) cout<<"the number is smaller than or equal to 5";
    else cout<<"the number is greater than 5";
}
