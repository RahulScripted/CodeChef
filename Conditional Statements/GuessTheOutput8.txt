What does the following code snippet do?

if (!(x > 0)) {
    // Code block
}


Select one of the following options:

- A) Executes the code block if x is greater than 0
- B) Executes the code block if x is less than 0
- C) Executes the code block if x is equal to 0
- D) Both option B and C



Correct Answer: D) Both option B and C

Explanation: The "!" negates the condition, so instead of executing when "x > 0" the code is executed when "x <= 0"
