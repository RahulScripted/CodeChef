// Alice and Bob recently got into running, and decided to compare how much they ran on different days. They each ran for N days â€” on the ith day, Alice ran Ai meters and Bob ran Bi meters. On each day,

// 1.  Alice is unhappy if Bob ran strictly more than twice her distance, and happy otherwise.
// 2.  Similarly, Bob is unhappy if Alice ran strictly more than twice his distance, and happy otherwise.

// On how many of the N days were both Alice and Bob happy?
