// What is the difference between the Run and Submit buttons? Run allows you to locally test your code on sample inputs and custom inputs. Custom inputs are small inputs - mainly for you to test your code

// Submit sends your code to the online judge to compare your Actual output and the Expected output. On submission - your code is checked against thousands of test cases which are included in the hidden or private test files. Your code / solution is complete only when you click Submit and get an AC (accepted) verdict
