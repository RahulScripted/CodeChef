// There are 100 houses located on a straight line. The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some M houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops. Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in. PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house. Devu knows that the cops run at a maximum speed of x houses per minute in a straight line and they will search for a maximum of y minutes. Devu wants to know how many houses are safe for him to escape from the cops. Help him in getting this information.
