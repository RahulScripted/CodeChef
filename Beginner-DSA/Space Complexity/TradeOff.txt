Which of the following is the best example of a space-time trade-off

1.  Merge sort with O(n log n) time and O(n) space

2.  Binary search with O(log n) time and O(1) space

3.  Dynamic programming reducing time from O(2^n) to O(n) but increasing space to O(n)

4.  Linear search with O(n) time and O(n) space





Answer: 3.  Dynamic programming reducing time from O(2^n) to O(n) but increasing space to O(n)
