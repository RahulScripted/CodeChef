// You have a grid with N rows and M columns. You have two types of tiles â€” one of dimensions 2 x 2 and the other of dimensions 1 x 1. You want to cover the grid using these two types of tiles in such a way that:

// 1.  Each cell of the grid is covered by exactly one tile; and

// 2.  The number of 1 x 1 tiles used is minimized.

// Find the minimum number of 1 x 1 tiles you have to use to fill the grid.
