// In Chefland, there are N houses numbered from 1 to N, ith house has a defense system having strength Ai. Chef suspects a bomb drop on one of the houses very soon. 

// 1.  A bomb with attack strength X can destroy the ith house, if the defense system of the ith house Ai, is strictly less than X. 

// 2.  Also, when the ith house is destroyed due to the bomb, all houses with indices j such that 1 â‰¤ j < i get destroyed as well irrespective of their defense system. 

// Given one bomb with attack strength X, find the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed.
