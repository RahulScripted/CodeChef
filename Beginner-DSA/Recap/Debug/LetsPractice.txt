Given a program to check whether the sum of all the elements of an array is divisible by 2 or not. We have inserted some checkpoints in the given program you must find out the good checkpoint which one must use for debugging the code.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int val = 0;
    cout<<val<<" = Checkpoint1\n";
    int arr[8] = {1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
    val = arr[0];
    for(int i=1;i<=7;i++){
        val = val+arr[i];
    }
    cout<<val<<" = Checkpoint2\n";
    val = val%2;
    if(val==1){
        cout<<"not divisible by 2\n";
    }
    else{
        cout<<"divisible by 2\n";
    }
}



Find the good checkpoint.

1.  Checkpoint1
2.  Checkpoint2


Answers: 2.  Checkpoint2
