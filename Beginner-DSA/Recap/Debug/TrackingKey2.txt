Given below is the program to count all the numbers which are divisible by 2,3 or 5 and are less than or equal to 30. Read the program carefully and find the correct output.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int count = 0;
    for(int i=1;i<=30;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            count++;
        }
    }
    cout<<count<<"\n";  // tracing count which stores number divisible by 2.
    for(int i=1;i<=30;i++){
        if(i%3==0&&i%2!=0){
            count++;
        }
    }
    cout<<count<<"\n"; // tracing count which stores number divisible by 2 and 3.
    for(int i=1;i<=30;i++){
        if(i%5==0&&i%2!=0&&i%3!=0){
            count++;
        }
    }
    cout<<count<<"\n"; // final answer which stores number divisible by 2,3 and 5

    return 0;
}
