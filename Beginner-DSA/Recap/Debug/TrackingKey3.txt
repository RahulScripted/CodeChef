Given an array of size 8 add all the elements of the array and check whether it is divisible by 2.
Read the program given below carefully and find the correct output.




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int arr[8] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
    int total = arr[0];
    for(int i=1;i<=7;i++){
        total = total+arr[i];
    }
    cout<<total<<"\n"; // 
    if(total%2==1){
        cout<<"Not divisible by 2\n";
    }
    else{
        cout<<"Divisible by 2\n";
    }
}



Find the correct output.
