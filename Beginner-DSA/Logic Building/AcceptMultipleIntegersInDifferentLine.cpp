// You need to write a program which does the following

// 1.  Accepts 2 integers as input in 1st line as the variables A, B

// 2.  Accepts 3 integers as input in the 2nd line as the variables C, D and E

// 3.  Accepts 4 integers as input in the 3rd line as the variables F, G, H and I

// Prints out 9 integers as output in a single line to the console
