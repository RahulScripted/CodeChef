// You need to write a program which does the following

// 1.  Accepts 2 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 1st line as the variables A, B

// 2.  Accepts 3 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 2nd line as the variables C, D, E

// 3.  Accepts 4 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 3rd line as the variables F, G, H, I

// Prints out 9 space separated strings as output in a single line to the console
