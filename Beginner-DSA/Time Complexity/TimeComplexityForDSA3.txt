Time complexity for DSA

```cpp

sum = 0
for i = 1 to N
    sum += i
print(sum)

```

Can this same algorithm run within a second if the constraints on N are: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5? Select one of the following.

1.  Yes
2.  No


Answer: Yes it can still run because 10 ^ 5 is still less than 10 ^ 8.
