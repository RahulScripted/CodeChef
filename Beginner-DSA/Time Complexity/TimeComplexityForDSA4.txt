Time complexity for DSA. Let’s look at another algorithm, which calculates the sum of all the pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= N.

```cpp

sum = 0
for i = 1 to N
     for j = 1 to N
          sum += i
          sum += j

```

Can this algorithm run within a second if the constraints on N are: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5? Select one of the following.

1.  Yes
2.  No


Answer: No. The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(N ^ 2), which is N * N operations for any input N.When N can be at most 10 ^ 5, the total operations will be 10 ^ 5 * 10 ^ 5 => 10 ^ 10. 10 ^ 10 is higher than 10 ^ 8 which is the number of operation a computer can run within a second. Thus this algorithm will give TLE or Time limit exceeded. But this algorithm will easily work if N is less than 10 ^ 4.
