Say you calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N using the following algorithm

```cpp

sum = 0
for i = 1 to N
    sum += i
print(sum)

```
and the constraints on N are: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100. Will the above algorithm run within 1 second? Select one of the following.

1.  Yes
2.  No


Answer: Yes. The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(N), which is N operations for any input N. When N can be at most 100, the total operations will also be 100. This can easily run within a second as the most computers support up-to 10 ^ 8 operations or 100 million operations within a second.
