Chef has recently started learning from the new CodeChef SQL course.

He has a table which initially has 4 rows and 5 columns. He then adds 2 extra rows to it. How many total cells does he have finally?


Select one of the following options.

- 28
- 30
- 32
- 20


Correct Answer: 30
Explanation: The new number of rows is (4 + 2), and so the total number of cells is (4 + 2) * 5 = 6 * 5 = 30.
