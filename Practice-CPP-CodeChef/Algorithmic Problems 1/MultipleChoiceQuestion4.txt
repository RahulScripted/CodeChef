Chef needs to park her car while she watches a movie. The parking charges at the theater are as follows:

Rs. X for the first 1 hour
Rs. Y for every extra hour after the first hour

If Chef parks her car for H hours, what is the total parking charges that she should pay?



Select one of the following options.
- X + Y * (H - 1)
- X + Y * H
- X * (H - 1) + Y
- (X + Y) * H


Correct Answer: X + Y*(H-1)

Explanation: Since the first hour needs Rs. X, we take that, and for the other H-1 hours, we take (H-1)*X. And add both of these together.
