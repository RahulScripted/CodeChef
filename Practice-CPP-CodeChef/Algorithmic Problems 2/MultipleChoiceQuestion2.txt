Alice has scored X marks in her test and Bob has scored Y marks in the same test. Alice is happy if she scored at least twice the marks of Bobâ€™s score. Print "Yes" if she is happy.


Select all the correct options.

- if(X > (2*Y)) { cout << "Yes\n"; }
- if(X >= (2*Y)) { cout << "Yes\n"; }
- if((2*Y) <= X) { cout << "Yes\n"; }
- if((2*X) >= Y) { cout << "Yes\n"; }


Correct Answer(s):
if(X >= (2*Y)) { cout << "Yes\n"; }
if((2*Y) <= X) { cout << "Yes\n"; }

Explanation: if(X >= (2*Y)) { cout << "Yes\n"; } and if((2*Y) <= X) { cout << "Yes\n"; } are the same!
