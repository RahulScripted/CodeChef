What will the following code output?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello " << endl << " World!";
}


Select one of the following options:
- Hello World!
- HelloWorld!
- Hello 
  World!
- None of the above


Correct Answer: None of the above

Explanation: endl moves to the next line, and " " acts as a space. So " World!" gives one character space before printing "World!".

Actual Output:
        Hello
        _World!
        ( _ : denotes empty space)
