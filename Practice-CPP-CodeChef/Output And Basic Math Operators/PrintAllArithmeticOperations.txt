Write a program that calculates and prints the results of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication between the numbers 8 and 4.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout<<(8 + 4)<<endl;
    cout<<(8 - 4)<<endl;
    cout<<(8 / 4)<<endl;
    cout<<(8 * 4)<<endl;
}


Output:
                12
                4
                2
                32
