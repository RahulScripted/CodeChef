What will be the output of the following code snippet?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int num = 5;
    switch(num) {
        case 1:
            cout << "One";
        case 5:
            cout << "Five";
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Default";
    }
}


Select one of the following options:

- One
- Five
- OneFive
- FiveDefault



Correct Answer: Five

Explanation: Since case 1 is not matched it does not matter whether there is a break. So when num is 5, the case 5 is matched, and the code associated with it is executed and then the break statement stops the further execution
