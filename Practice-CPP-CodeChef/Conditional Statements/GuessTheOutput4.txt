What will be the output of the following code?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 5;
    if (x > y) cout << "x is greater";
    else if (y >= x) cout << "y is greater";
    else cout << "Both are equal";
}


Select one of the following options:

- x is greater
- y is greater
- Both are equal
- Throws an error


Correct Answer: y is greater

Explanation: The code compares x and y and prints the second message since the comparison result is true and does not execute the next else condition
