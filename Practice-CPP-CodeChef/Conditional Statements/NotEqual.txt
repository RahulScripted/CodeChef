How do you check if a number is not equal to 5?


Select the correct option(s):

- if (num == 5)
- if (!(num == 5))
- if (!(num != 5))
- if (num != 5)


Correct Answer(s):
if (!(num == 5))
if (num != 5)

Explanation: If num is not equal to 5 "num == 5" equate to false and negation of false "!(false)" becomes true. If(num != 5) is also another and more common way to check this.
