What does the break statement do in the below provided loop?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;
        }
    cout << i << " ";
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- Exits the loop when i is equal to 5
- Continues to the next iteration when i is equal to 5
- Skips the loop entirely
- Prints numbers from 0 to 10 and skip 5



Correct Answer: Exits the loop when i is equal to 5

Explanation: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. In this case, the loop will exit when the value of i is equal to 5
