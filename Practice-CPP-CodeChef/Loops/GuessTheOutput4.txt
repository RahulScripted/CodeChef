What does the following code snippet do?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 1;
    while (x > 0){
        cout << x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- Syntax error
- Infinite loop
- Compilation error
- None of the above 



Correct Answer: Infinite loop
Explanation: Since the initial value of x is 1 and it keeps on increasing it will never be less than or equal to 0, it is an infinite loop
