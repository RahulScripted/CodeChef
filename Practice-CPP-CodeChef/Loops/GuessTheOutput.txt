What does the following code snippet do?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int count = 0;
    while (count < 5) {
        cout << count << " ";
        count++;
    }
}


Select one of the following options:

- Prints numbers 0 to 4 with spaces
- Prints numbers 1 to 5 with spaces
- Prints numbers 0 to 4 without spaces
- Prints numbers 1 to 5 without spaces



Correct Answer: Prints numbers 0 to 4 with spaces

Explanation: The while loop iterates while the condition "count < 5" is true. It prints the value of the count and increments it until the count becomes 5
