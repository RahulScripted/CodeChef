How many times will the following do/while loop execute?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    do {
        cout << x << " ";
        x--;
    } while (x > 0);
}



Select one of the following options:

- 4
- 5
- 6
- Infinite loop



Correct Answer: 5

Explanation: The do/while loop will execute at least once, as the condition is checked after the first iteration. It will repeat as long as x is greater than 0
