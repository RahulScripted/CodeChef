What output will the following code produce?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
        cout << i << " ";
        if (i % 2 != 0) {
            continue;
        }
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- 1 3 5
- 1 2 3 4 5
- 0 1 2 3 4 5
- 0 2 4



Correct Answer: 0 1 2 3 4 5

Explanation: The loop prints all the numbers from 0 to 5 as the numbers are printed before the continue statement, which means that the continue statement does not affect the output at all
