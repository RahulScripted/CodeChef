In a for-each loop, what does the variable num represent in the following code?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    for (int num : arr) {
        cout << num * 2 << " ";
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- Index of the array element
- Index of the array
- Value of each element in the array
- Length of the array



Correct Answer: Value of each element in the array
