How many times will the following loop iterate?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 5) {
    // code block
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- 20 times
- 19 times
- 100 times
- 21 times



Correct Answer: 20 times

Explanation: The loop increments i by 5 in each iteration, so when the value of i is equal to 100 the loop exists. So the loop will iterate 20 times (100 / 5)
