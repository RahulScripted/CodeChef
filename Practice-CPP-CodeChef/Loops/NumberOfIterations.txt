How many times will the following loop iterate?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 != 0) {
          continue;
        }
        cout << i << " ";
    }
}



Select one of the following options:

- 10 times
- 5 times
- 9 times
- 6 times



Correct Answer: 10 times

Explanation: The loop will be iterated for all the values of i from 1 to 10, i.e 10 times, but the "cout << i" line will only be executed only 5 times and the continue statement will skip to the next iteration whenever i is odd
