What does the following code snippet do?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    double prices[4] = {9.99, 19.99, 29.99, 39.99};
    cout << prices[4];
}


Select one of the following options:

- Prints 9.99
- Prints 39.99
- Compilation error
- Prints a random value



Correct Answer: Prints a random value

Explanation: The code attempts to access an element at index 4, which is out of bounds, leading to unpredictable behaviour.
