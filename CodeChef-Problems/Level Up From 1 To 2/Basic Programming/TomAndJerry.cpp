// There is a grid of size 10 ^ 5 X 10 ^ 5 , covered completely in railway tracks. Tom is riding in a train, currently in cell (a , b), and Jerry is tied up in a different cell (c , d), unable to move. The train has no breaks. It shall move exactly K steps, and then its fuel will run out and it shall stop. In one step, the train must move to one of its neighboring cells, sharing a side. Tom can’t move without the train, as the grid is covered in tracks. Can Tom reach Jerry’s cell after exactly K steps?
