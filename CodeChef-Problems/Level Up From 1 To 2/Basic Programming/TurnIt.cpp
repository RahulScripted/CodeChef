// Chef is playing Need For Speed. Currently, his car is running on a straight road with a velocity U metres per second and approaching a 90 degree turn which is S metres away from him. To successfully cross the turn, velocity of the car when entering the turn must not exceed V metres per second. The brakes of Chef's car allow him to slow down with a deceleration (negative acceleration) not exceeding A metres per squared second. Tell him whether he can cross the turn successfully. The velocity v when entering the turn can be determined from Newton's 2nd law to be V ^ 2 = U ^ 2 + 2 ⋅ a ⋅ S if the car is moving with a uniform acceleration a.
