// Sarthak and Anuradha are very good friends and are eager to participate in an event called Equinox. It is a game of words. In this game, N strings S1,…,SN are given. For each string Si, if it starts with one of the letters of the word “EQUINOX”, Sarthak gets A points and if not, Anuradha gets B points. The one who has more points at the end of the game wins. If they both the same number of points, the game is a draw. Print the winner of the game, if any, otherwise print “DRAW”.
