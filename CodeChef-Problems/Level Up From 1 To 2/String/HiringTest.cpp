// A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. N candidates appeared for the test, and each of them faced M problems. Each problem was either unsolved by a candidate (denoted by 'U'), solved partially (denoted by 'P'), or solved completely (denoted by 'F'). To pass the test, each candidate needs to either solve X or more problems completely, or solve ( X − 1) problems completely, and Y or more problems partially. Given the above specifications as input, print a line containing N integers. The ith integer should be 1 if the ith candidate has passed the test, else it should be 0.
