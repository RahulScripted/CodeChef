// Sergey has made N measurements. Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made. In order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements. Could you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?
