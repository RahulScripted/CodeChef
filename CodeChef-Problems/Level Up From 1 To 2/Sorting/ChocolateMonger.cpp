// There are n chocolates, and you are given an array of n numbers where the i-th number Ai is the flavour type of the i-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least x number of chocolates for her little brother. Find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.
