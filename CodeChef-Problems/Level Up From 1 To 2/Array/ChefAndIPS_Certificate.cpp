// There were N students (numbered 1 through N) participating in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of K lectures (numbered 1 through K). For each student i and each lecture j, the i-th student watched the j-th lecture for Tij minutes. Additionally, for each student i, we know that this student asked the question, "What is the criteria for getting a certificate?" Qi times. The criteria for getting a certificate is that a student must have watched at least M minutes of lectures in total and they must have asked the question no more than 10 times.Find out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.
