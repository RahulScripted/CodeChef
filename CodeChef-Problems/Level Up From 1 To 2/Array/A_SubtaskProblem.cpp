// Chef recently solved his first problem on CodeChef. The problem he solved has N test cases. He gets a score for his submission according to the following rules:

// 1.  If Chef’s code passes all the N test cases, he gets 100 points.
// 2.  If Chef’s code does not pass all the test cases, but passes all the first M (M < N) test cases, he gets 
// K (K < 100) points.
// 3.  If the conditions 1 and 2 are not satisfied, Chef does not get any points (i.e his score remains at 0 points).

// You are given a binary array A1,A2,…,AN of length N, where Ai = 1 denotes Chef's code passed the ith test case, Ai = 0 denotes otherwise. You are also given the two integers M,K. Can you find how many points does Chef get?
