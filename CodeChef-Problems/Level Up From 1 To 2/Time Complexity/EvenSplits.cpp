// You are given a binary string S of length N. You can perform the following operation on it: 

// 1.  Pick any non-empty even-length subsequence of the string.
// 2.  Suppose the subsequence has length 2k. Then, move the first k characters to the beginning of S and the other k to the end of S (without changing their order).

// What is the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after performing this operation several (possibly, zero) times?
