// Pushpa has entered Chefland and wants to establish Pushpa-Raj here too. Chefland has N towers where the height of the ith tower is Hi. To establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa does the following: 

// 1.  Initially, Pushpa chooses any tower i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and lands on the roof of that tower.
// 2.  Let X denote the height of the tower Pushpa is currently on, then, Pushpa can land on the roof of any tower (1 ≤ j ≤ N) such that the height of the jth tower is (X+1).

// Let i denote the index of the tower on which Pushpa lands, then, the height of all towers except tower i increases by 1 after each jump including the initial jump. To establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa wants to land at the maximum height possible. Determine the maximum height Pushpa can reach.
