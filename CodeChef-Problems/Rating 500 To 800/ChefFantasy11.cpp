// All of Chef's friends are playing fantasy cricket based upon the ODI World Cup, and Chef would like to join them. For a certain cricket match, Chef has decided upon his team of 11 players. However, he hasn't yet decided who should be the captain and who should be the vice-captain. He's narrowed his decision down to N players out of the 11, from which he'll choose one to be the captain and one to be the vice captain. How many different choices does he have?
