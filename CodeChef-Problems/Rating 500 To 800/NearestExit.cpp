// There are two exits in a bus with 100 seats:

// 1. First exit is located beside seat number 1
// 2. Second exit is located beside seat number 100.

// Seats are arranged in a straight line from 1 to 100 with equal spacing between any 2 adjacent seats. A passenger prefers to choose the nearest exit while leaving the bus. Determine the exit taken by passenger sitting on seat X.
