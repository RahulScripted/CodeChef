// Chef is watching a football match. The current score is A:B, that is, team1 has scored A goals and team2 has scored B goals. Chef wonders if it is possible for the score to become C:D at a later point in the game (i.e. team1 has scored C goals and team2 has scored D goals). Can you help Chef by answering his question?
