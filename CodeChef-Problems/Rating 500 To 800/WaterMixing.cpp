// Chef is setting up a perfect bath for himself. He has X litres of hot water and Y litres of cold water. The initial temperature of water in his bathtub is A degrees. On mixing water, the temperature of the bathtub changes as following:

// 1. The temperature rises by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of hot water.
// 2. The temperature drops by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of cold water.

// Determine whether he can set the temperature to B degrees for a perfect bath.
