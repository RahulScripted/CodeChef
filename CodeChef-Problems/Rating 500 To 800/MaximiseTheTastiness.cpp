// Chef is making a dish that consists of exactly two ingredients. He has four ingredients A,B,C and D with tastiness a,b,c, and d respectively. He can use either A or B as the first ingredient and either C or D as the second ingredient. The tastiness of a dish is the sum of tastiness of its ingredients. Find the maximum possible tastiness of the dish that the chef can prepare.
