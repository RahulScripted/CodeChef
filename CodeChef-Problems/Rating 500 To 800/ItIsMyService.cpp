// Alice and Bob are playing a game of table tennis where irrespective of the point scored, every player makes 2 consecutive serves before the service changes. Alice makes the first serve of the match. Therefore the first 2 serves will be made by Alice, then the next 2 serves will be made by Bob and so on.
