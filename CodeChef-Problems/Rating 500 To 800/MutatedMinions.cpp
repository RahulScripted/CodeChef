// Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions. Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value. Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations. Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.
