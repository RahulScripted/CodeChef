// Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. Luckily there's a sale going on under which Chef gets the following offer: If Chef buys 3 items then he gets the item (out of those 3 items) having the lowest price as free. Chef buys 3 items having prices A, B and C respectively. What is the amount of money Chef needs to pay?
