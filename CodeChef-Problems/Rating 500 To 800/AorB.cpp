// There are two problems in a contest.

// 1. Problem A is worth 500 points at the start of the contest.
// 2. Problem B is worth 1000 points at the start of the contest.

// Once the contest starts, after each minute:

// 1. Maximum points of Problem A reduce by 2 points .
// 2. Maximum points of Problem B reduce by 4 points.

// It is known that Chef requires X minutes to solve Problem A correctly and Y minutes to solve Problem B correctly. Find the maximum number of points Chef can score if he optimally decides the order of attempting both the problems.
