// There are three people sitting in a room - Alice, Bob, and Charlie. They need to decide on the temperature to set on the air conditioner. Everyone has a demand each:

// 1. Alice wants the temperature to be at least A degrees.
// 2. Bob wants the temperature to be at most B degrees.
// 3. Charlie wants the temperature to be at least C degrees.

// Can they all agree on some temperature, or not?
