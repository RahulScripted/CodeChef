// While Alice was drinking sugarcane juice, she started wondering about the following facts:

// 1. The juicer sells each glass of sugarcane juice for 50 coins.
// 2. He spends 20% of his total income on buying sugarcane.
// 3. He spends 20% of his total income on buying salt and mint leaves.
// 4. He spends 30% of his total income on shop rent.

// Alice wonders, what is the juicer's profit (in coins) when he sells N glasses of sugarcane juice?
