// Chef is very hungry. So, Chef goes to a shop selling burgers. The shop has 2 types of burgers:

// 1.  Normal burgers, which cost X rupees each
// 2.  Premium burgers, which cost Y rupees each (where Y > X)

// Chef has R rupees. Chef wants to buy exactly N burgers. He also wants to maximize the number of premium burgers he buys. Determine the number of burgers of both types Chef must buy. Output -1 if it is not possible for Chef to buy N burgers.
