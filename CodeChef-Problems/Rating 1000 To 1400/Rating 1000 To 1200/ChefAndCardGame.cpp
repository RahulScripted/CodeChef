// Chef is playing a card game with his friend Morty Smith. The rules of the game are as follows:

// 1.  There are two piles of cards, pile A and pile 
// B, each with N cards in it. Pile A belongs to Chef and pile B belongs to Morty.

// 2.  Each card has one positive integer on it

// 3.  The 'power' of a card is defined as the sum of digits of the integer on that card

// 4.  The game consists of N rounds

// 5.  In each round, both players simultaneously draw one card each from the top of their piles and the player who draws the card with higher power wins this round and gets a point. If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get 1 point each.

// 6.  The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of N rounds. If both players have equal number of points then the game ends in a draw.

// The game is now over and Chef has told Morty to find the winner. Unfortunately, this task is too complex for him. Help Morty find the winner.

// 0 if Chef wins, 1 if Morty wins, 2 if it is a draw,
