// A binary string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters of the string are equal. Formally, a binary string T of length M is called alternating if Ti not equal to Ti+1 for each 1 ≤ i < M. You are given a binary string S of length N. You would like to rearrange the characters of S such that the length of the longest alternating substring of S is maximum. Find this maximum value. A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
