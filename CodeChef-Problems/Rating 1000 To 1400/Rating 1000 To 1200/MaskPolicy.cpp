// A city has been infected by a contagious virus. In a survey, it was found that A out of the N people living in the city are currently infected. It has been observed that the only way for a person to get infected is if he comes in contact with an already infected person, and both of them are NOT wearing a mask. The mayor of the city wants to make a new Mask Policy and find out the minimum number of people that will be required to wear a mask to avoid the further spread of the virus. Help the mayor in finding this number.
