// In Ciel's restaurant, a waiter is training. Since the waiter isn't good at arithmetic, sometimes he gives guests wrong change. Ciel gives him a simple problem. What is A-B (A minus B) ? Surprisingly, his answer is wrong. To be more precise, his answer has exactly one wrong digit. Can you imagine this? Can you make the same mistake in this problem?
