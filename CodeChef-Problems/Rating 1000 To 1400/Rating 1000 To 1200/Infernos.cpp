// Ved started playing a new mobile game called Fighting Clans. An army of N enemies is approaching his base. The ith enemy has Hi health points. An enemy gets killed if his health points become 0. Ved defends his base using a weapon named Inferno. He can set the Inferno to one of the following two modes:

// 1.  Single-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target exactly one living enemy and cause damage of at most X health points.

// 2.  Multi-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target all living enemies and cause damage of 1 health point to each of them.

// Find the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.
