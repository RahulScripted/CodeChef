// Chef has 3 bags that she wants to take on a flight. They weigh A, B, and C kgs respectively. She wants to check-in exactly two of these bags and carry the remaining one bag with her. The airline restrictions says that the total sum of the weights of the bags that are checked-in cannot exceed D kgs and the weight of the bag which is carried cannot exceed E kgs. Find if Chef can take all the three bags on the flight.
