// Chef wants to organize a contest. Predicting difficulty levels of the problems can be a daunting task. Chef wants his contests to be balanced in terms of difficulty levels of the problems. Assume a contest had total P participants. A problem that was solved by at least half of the participants (i.e. P / 2 (integer division)) is said to be cakewalk difficulty. A problem solved by at max P / 10 (integer division) participants is categorized to be a hard difficulty.Chef wants the contest to be balanced. According to him, a balanced contest must have exactly 1 cakewalk and exactly 2 hard problems. You are given the description of N problems and the number of participants solving those problems. Can you tell whether the contest was balanced or not?
