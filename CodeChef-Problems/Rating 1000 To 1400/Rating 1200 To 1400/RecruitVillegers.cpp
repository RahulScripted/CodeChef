He cannot recruit minions from both villages because then his team will have internal conflicts. Gru is now in a dilemma about which village to recruit as he wants to have the strongest possible team. You are given coordinates of houses on the planet. Each house has exactly one minion and his power is given. The planet of minion is considered as a 2-D plane and the river is denoted by a straight line (y = mx + c).
