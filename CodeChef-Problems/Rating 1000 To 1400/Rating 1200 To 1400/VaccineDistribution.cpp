// Finally, a COVID vaccine is out on the market and the Chefland government has asked you to form a plan to distribute it to the public as soon as possible. There are a total of N people with ages a1, a2,…,aN.There is only one hospital where vaccination is done and it is only possible to vaccinate up to D people per day. Anyone whose age is ≥ 80 or ≤ 9 is considered to be at risk. On each day, you may not vaccinate both a person who is at risk and a person who is not at risk. Find the smallest number of days needed to vaccinate everyone.
