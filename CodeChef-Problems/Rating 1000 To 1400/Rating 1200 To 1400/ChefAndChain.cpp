// Chef had a hard day and want to play little bit. The game is called "Chain". Chef has the sequence of symbols. Each symbol is either '-' or '+'. The sequence is called Chain if each two neighboring symbols of sequence are either '-+' or '+-'. Help Chef to calculate the minimum number of symbols he need to replace (ex. '-' to '+' or '+' to '-') to receive a Chain sequence.
