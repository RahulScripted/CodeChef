// Chef is working on his swap-based sorting algorithm for strings. Given a string S of length N, he wants to know whether he can sort the string using his algorithm.According to the algorithm, one can perform the following operation on string S any number of times: Choose some index (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and swap the ith character from the front and the ith character from the back. More formally, choose an index i and swap Si and S(N+1−i). Help Chef find if it is possible to sort the string using any (possibly zero) number of operations.
