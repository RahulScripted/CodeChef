// Chef considers a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets beautiful if all the characters of the string are vowels. Chef has a string S consisting of lowercase English alphabets, of length N. He wants to convert S into a beautiful string T. In order to do so, Chef does the following operation on every character of the string:

// 1.  If the character is a consonant, change the character to its closest vowel.
// 2.  If the character is a vowel, don't change it.

// Chef realizes that the final string T is not unique. Chef wonders, what is the total number of distinct beautiful strings T that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string S. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 1e9 + 7.
