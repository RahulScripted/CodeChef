// The correct way of evaluating an expression with *,+ and - is, first multiplication, then addition, and then subtraction. You are given integers N and X. Your task is to generate a string S of length N consisting only of *,+ and - such that when these N operators are placed in order between (N+1) ones, the result of the expression becomes X. If multiple such strings exist, print any of them. If no such string exists, print -1 instead.
