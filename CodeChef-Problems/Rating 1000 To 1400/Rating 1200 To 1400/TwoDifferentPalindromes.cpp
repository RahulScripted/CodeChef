// You are given two positive integers A and B. You need to construct two different binary strings (i.e, they are strings which consist of only 0's and 1's), which satisfy these two conditions:

// 1.  Both the strings should be palindromes.
// 2.  Each string should have exactly A 0's, and exactly B 1's in them.

// Output Yes if two such different binary strings can be constructed and No otherwise.
