// Chef is interested in the sum of GCDs of all prefixes of a permutation of the integers {1,2,…,N}. Formally, for a permutation P = [P1,P2,…,PN] of {1,2,…,N}, let us define a function Fi = gcd(A1,A2,A3,…,Ai). Chef is interested in the value of F1 + F2 +…+FN. Now, Chef wants to find a permutation of {1,2,…,N} which has the given sum equal to X. Please help Chef find one such permutation. In case there is no such permutation, print -1. In case of multiple answers, any of them will be accepted. A permutation of {1,2,…,N} is a sequence of numbers from 1 to N in which each number occurs exactly once.
