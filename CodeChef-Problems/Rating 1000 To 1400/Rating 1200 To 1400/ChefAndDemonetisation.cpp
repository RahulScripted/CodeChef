// In a country called Chef Land, there was a lot of monetary fraud, so Chefu, the head of the country, decided to choose new denominations of the local currency ― all even-valued coins up to an integer N should exist. After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 1. Formally, you are given an integer N; for v = 1 and each even positive integer v ≤ N, coins with value v exist. You are also given an integer S. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price S.
