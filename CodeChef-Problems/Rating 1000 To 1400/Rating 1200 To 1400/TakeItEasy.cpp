// Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see On a Halloween evening, young Tim embarks on a candy-filled quest with his friends, dressed as ghouls and witches. There are N friends, initially the i-th of them has Ai candies. To truly savor the spooky spirit, Tim wishes for everyone to have an equal number of candies. To achieve this, he is armed with a magical operation which is as follows:

// 1.  First, Tim chooses two integers i and j (1 ≤ i,j ≤ N), denoting the indices of two of his friends.

// 2.  Next, he chooses an integer k that's at least 1, while also satisfying 2^k ≤Ai. That is, the inequality 2 ≤ 2^k ≤ Ai should hold.

// 3.  Finally, Tim takes away 2^k candies from friend i and gives them to the friend j. That is, their candy counts change to (Ai - 2^k) and (Aj + 2^k) respectively.

// Determine whether all of Tim's friends can have an equal number of candies in the end, after some (possibly zero) operations are performed.
