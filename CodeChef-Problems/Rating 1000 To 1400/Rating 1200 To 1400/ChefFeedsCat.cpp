// Chef owns N cats (numbered 1 through N) and he wants to feed them. There are M identical cans of cat food; each can must be used to feed exactly one cat and Chef can only feed one cat at a time. Chef wrote down the order in which he wants to feed the cats: a sequence A1,A2,…,AM. An order of feeding cats is fair if there is no moment where Chef feeds a cat that has already been fed strictly more times than some other cat. Help Chef — tell him if the order in which he wants to feed the cats is fair.
