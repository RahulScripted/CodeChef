// There are N students in a class. Recently, an exam on Advanced Algorithms was conducted with maximum score M and minimum score 0. The average score of the class was found out to be exactly X. Given that a student having score strictly greater than the average receives an A grade, find the maximum number of students that can receive an A grade.
