// In the ROT-K cipher, each character in the string is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The value of K represents the number of positions to shift. For instance, in ROT-2, each character is shifted 2 positions. The ROT-2 cipher of the string code is eqfg.Note that the rotation is performed in a circular manner, meaning that if the character z is shifted by one position, we obtain the character a. You are given strings S,T, and U, each of length N, such that the ROT-K cipher of string S is string T. Find the ROT-K cipher of string U.
