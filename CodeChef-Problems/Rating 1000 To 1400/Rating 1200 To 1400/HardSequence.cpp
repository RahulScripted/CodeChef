// Chef decided to write an infinite sequence. Initially, he wrote 0, and then he started repeating the following process:

// 1.  Look at the last element written so far (the l-th element if the sequence has length l so far); let's denote it by x.

// 2.  If x does not occur anywhere earlier in the sequence, the next element in the sequence is 0.

// 3.  Otherwise, look at the previous occurrence of x in the sequence, i.e. the k-th element, where k < l, this element is equal to x and all elements between the k + 1 -th and l-1-th are different from x. The next element is l - k, i.e. the distance between the last two occurrences of x. Chef has given you a task to perform. Consider the N-th element of the sequence (denoted by x) and the first N elements of the sequence. Find the number of occurrences of x among these N elements.
