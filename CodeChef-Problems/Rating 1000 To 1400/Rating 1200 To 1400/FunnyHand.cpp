// MoEngage has 3 decks. Each deck consists of N cards, numbered from 1 to N. He draws out 1 card from each deck randomly with each card having an equal probability of being drawn. MoEngage drew cards numbered A and B from the decks 1 and 2 respectively. Now, he wonders what is the probability that he will end up with a funny hand after drawing the third card. A funny hand is when 3 consecutive numbered cards are present in your hand. Help MoEngage calculate the probability of ending up with a funny hand after drawing the third card. If the final probability of ending up with a funny hand is P, you need to print the value P . N. It can be shown that this value is an integer.
