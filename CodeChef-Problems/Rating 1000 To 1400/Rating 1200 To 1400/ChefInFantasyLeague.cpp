// Chef is going to start playing Fantasy Football League (FFL) this season. In FFL, each team consists of exactly 15 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Chef has already bought 13 players; he is only missing one defender and one forward. There are N available players (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price Pi. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed 100 dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him S dollars. Can you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?
