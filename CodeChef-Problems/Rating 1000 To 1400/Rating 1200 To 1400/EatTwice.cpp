// Hasan has recently heard about Chef's restaurant, which serves the tastiest dishes. The restaurant has published a list of N dishes (numbered 1 through N) that will be served in the next M days. For each valid i, the i-th dish will be served only on the Di-th day. Hasan has investigated their tastiness and he knows that for each valid i, the i-th dish has tastiness Vi. Hasan's budget is only large enough to try two dishes. He wants to choose these two dishes in such a way that their total (summed up) tastiness is as large as possible. However, he cannot try 2 dishes on the same day. Help Hasan and calculate the maximum possible total tastiness of the dishes he should try.
