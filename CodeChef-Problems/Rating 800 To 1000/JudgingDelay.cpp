// You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are N submissions, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 5 minutes.
