// There are 3 problems in a contest namely A,B,C respectively. Alice bets Bob that problem C is the hardest while Bob says that problem B will be the hardest. You are given three integers SA,SB,SC which denotes the number of successful submissions of the problems A,B,C respectively. It is guaranteed that each problem has a different number of submissions. Determine who wins the bet.

// 1.  If Alice wins the bet (i.e. problem C is the hardest), then output Alice.
// 2.  If Bob wins the bet (i.e. problem B is the hardest), then output Bob.
// 3.  If no one wins the bet (i.e. problem A is the hardest), then output Draw.
