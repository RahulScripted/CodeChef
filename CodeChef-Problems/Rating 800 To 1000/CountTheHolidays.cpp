// A particular month has 30 days, numbered from 1 to 30. Day 1 is a Monday, and the usual 7-day week is followed (so day 2 is Tuesday, day 3 is Wednesday, and so on). Every Saturday and Sunday is a holiday. There are N festival days, which are also holidays. Note that it is possible for a festival day to occur on a Saturday or Sunday. You are given the dates of the festivals. Determine the total number of holidays in this month.
