// Chef is planning to buy a new car for his birthday. After a long search, he is left with 2 choices:

// 1.  Car 1: Runs on diesel with a fuel economy of x1 km/l
// 2.  Car 2: Runs on petrol with a fuel economy of x2 km/l

// Chef also knows that 
// 1.  The current price of diesel is y1 rupees per litre
// 2.  The current price of petrol is y2 rupees per litre

// Assuming that both cars cost the same and that the price of fuel remains constant, which car will minimize Chef's expenses? Print your answer as a single integer in the following format

// 1.  If it is better to choose Car 1, print -1
// 2.  If both the cars will result in the same expenses, print 0
// 3.  If it is better to choose Car 2, print 1
