// The World Chess Championship 2022 is about to start. 14 Classical games will be played between Chef and Carlsen in the championship, where each game has one of three outcomes — it can be won by Carlsen, won by Chef, or it can be a draw. The winner of a game gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0 points. If it’s a draw, both players get 1 point each. The total prize pool of the championship is 100 ⋅ X. At end of the 14 Classical games, if one player has strictly more points than the other, he is declared the champion and gets 60 ⋅ X as his prize money, and the loser gets 40 ⋅ X. If the total points are tied, then the defending champion Carlsen is declared the winner. However, if this happens, the winner gets only 55 ⋅ X, and the loser gets 45 ⋅ X. Given the results of all the 14 games, output the prize money that Carlsen receives. The results are given as a string of length 14 consisting of the characters C, N, and D.

// C denotes a victory by Carlsen.
// N denotes a victory by Chef.
// D denotes a draw.
