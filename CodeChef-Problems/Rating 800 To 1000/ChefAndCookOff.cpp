// Chef has obtained the results of a past Cook-Off. He wants to estimate the skill level of each contestant. The contestants can be classified with high probability (w.h.p.) based on the number of solved problems:

// 1.  A contestant that solved exactly 0 problems is a beginner.
// 2.  A contestant that solved exactly 1 problem is a junior developer.
// 3.  A contestant that solved exactly 2 problems is a middle developer.
// 4.  A contestant that solved exactly 3 problems is a senior developer.
// 5.  A contestant that solved exactly 4 problems is a hacker.
// 6.  A contestant that solved all five problems is Jeff Dean.
