// Finally, College has started calling students back to campus. There are so many students and thus due to some safety measures the college canâ€™t call back all the students on the same day. It currently has the capacity of screening K students on a single day. There is a total of N students. What's the minimum number of days required for all the students to be back on the campus?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int testCase;
    cout<<"Enter the no. of test cases : ";
    cin>>testCase;
    while(testCase--){
        int noOfStudents,noOfCapacityScreeningStudents;

        cout<<"Enter the no. of students : ";
        cin>>noOfStudents;

        cout<<"Enter the no. of capacity screening students : ";
        cin>>noOfCapacityScreeningStudents;

        if(noOfStudents % noOfCapacityScreeningStudents == 0) cout<<"The minimum number of days required for all the students to be back on the campus will be : "<<(noOfStudents / noOfCapacityScreeningStudents)<<endl;

        else cout<<"The minimum number of days required for all the students to be back on the campus will be : "<<(noOfStudents / noOfCapacityScreeningStudents) + 1<<endl;
    }
