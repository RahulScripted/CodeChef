// Chefland is holding a virtual marathon for the categories 10 km, 21 km and 42 km having prizes A,B,C (A < B < C) respectively to promote physical fitness. In order to claim the prize in a particular category the person must cover the total distance for that category within D days. Also a single person cannot apply in multiple categories. Given the maximum distance d km that Chef can cover in a single day, find the maximum prize that Chef can win at the end of D days. If Chef can't win any prize, print 0.
