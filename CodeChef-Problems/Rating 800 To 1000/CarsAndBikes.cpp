// Chef opened a company which manufactures cars and bikes. Each car requires 4 tyres while each bike requires 2 tyres. Chef has a total of N tyres (N is even). He wants to manufacture maximum number of cars from these tyres and then manufacture bikes from the remaining tyres. Chef's friend went to Chef to purchase a bike. If Chef's company has manufactured even a single bike then Chef's friend will be able to purchase it. Determine whether he will be able to purchase the bike or not.
