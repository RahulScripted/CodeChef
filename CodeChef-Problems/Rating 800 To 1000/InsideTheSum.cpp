// Shubman Gill is playing an international match. He played a total of N balls, where, in the ith ball, he scored Ai runs. The strike rate of a player is calculated as : (no. of runs / no. of balls played) x 100. Preet, a math enthusiast, is currently watching the match. Help him find the number of times, Shubman's strike rate became exactly 100.
