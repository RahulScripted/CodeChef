// The fuel economy of a car is the distance which it can travel on one litre of fuel. The base fuel economy (i.e, its fuel economy when there is only one person - the driver - in the car) of a certain car is M kilometers per litre. It was also observed that every extra passenger in the car decreases the fuel economy by 1 kilometer per litre. P people want to take this car for a journey. They know that the car currently has V litres of fuel in its tank. What is the maximum distance this car can travel under the given conditions, assuming that all P people always stay in the car and no refuelling can be done?
