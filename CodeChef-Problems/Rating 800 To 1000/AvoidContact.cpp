// A hostel has N rooms in a straight line. It has to accommodate X people. Unfortunately, out of these X people, Y of them are infected with chickenpox. Due to safety norms, the following precaution must be taken: No person should occupy a room directly adjacent to a room occupied by a chickenpox-infected person. In particular, two chickenpox-infected people cannot occupy adjacent rooms. What's the minimum value of N for which all the people can be accommodated in the hostel, following the above condition?
