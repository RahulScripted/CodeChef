// Bearland has infinitely many cities, numbered starting from 1. Some pairs of cities are connected with bidirectional roads:

// There are roads 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and so on (there is a road between cities 2*i+1 and 2*i+2 for every non-negative integer i).
// There are roads 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, ... (between every two consecutive odd numbers).
// There are roads 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, ... (between every two consecutive even numbers).

// You are given Q queries. In each query, for the given pair of different cities a and b, you should check if there is a road between them. For each query, print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
