// The weather report of Chefland is Good if the number of sunny days in a week is strictly greater than the number of rainy days. Given 7 integers A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A 6,A7 where Ai = 1 denotes that the ith day of week in Chefland is a sunny day, Ai = 0 denotes that the ith day in Chefland is a rainy day.
