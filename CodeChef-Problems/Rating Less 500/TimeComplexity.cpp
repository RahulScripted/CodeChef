// A sorting algorithm A is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm B if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than algorithm B. Given that algorithm A uses X comparisons to sort an array and algorithm B uses Y comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm A has more time complexity.
