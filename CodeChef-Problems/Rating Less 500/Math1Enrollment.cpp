// For the upcoming semester, the admins of your university decided to keep a total of X seats for the MATH-1 course. A student interest survey was conducted by the admins and it was found that Y students were interested in taking up the MATH-1 course. Find the minimum number of extra seats that the admins need to add into the MATH-1 course to make sure that every student who is interested in taking the course would be able to do so.

        cout<<"Enter the no. of interest candidate for taking up Math-1 Course : ";
        cin>>noOfInterestCandidate;
