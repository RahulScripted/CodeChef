// Alice has a bucket of water initially having W litres of water in it. The maximum capacity of the bucket is X liters. Alice turned on the tap and the water starts flowing into the bucket at a rate of Y litres/hour. She left the tap running for exactly Z hours. Determine whether the bucket has been overflown, filled exactly, or is still left unfilled.
