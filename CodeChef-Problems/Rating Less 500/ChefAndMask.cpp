// Chef is shopping for masks. In the shop, he encounters 2 types of masks:

// 1.  Disposable Masks — cost X but last only 1 day.
// 2.  Cloth Masks — cost Y but last 10 days.

// Chef wants to buy masks to last him 100 days. He will buy the masks which cost him the least. In case there is a tie in terms of cost, Chef will be eco-friendly and choose the cloth masks. Which type of mask will Chef choose?
