// Chef was driving on a highway at a speed of X km/hour. To avoid accidents, there are fine imposed on over-speeding as follows:

// 1.  No fine if the speed of the car ≤ 70 km/hour.
// 2.  Rs 500 fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than 70 and less than 100.
// 3.  Rs 2000 fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than 100.

// Determine the fine Chef needs to pay.
