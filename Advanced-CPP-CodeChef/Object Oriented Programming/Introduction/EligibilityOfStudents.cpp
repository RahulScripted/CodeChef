// You are tasked with designing a simple program that determines the eligibility of students based on their scores and ages.

// Class Definitions:

// Student class:
// Attributes:
// name (String): The name of the student.
// score (int): The student's academic score.
// age (int): The age of the student.

// Methods:
// eligible(): A method that checks the student's eligibility and prints "YES" if the score is greater than 10 and the age is greater than 20. Otherwise, it prints "NO."
