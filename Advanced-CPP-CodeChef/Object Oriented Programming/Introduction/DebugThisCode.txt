What is wrong with the following code?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    Point p = {3, 7};

    cout << "Point: (" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")\n";

    return 0;
}



Select multiple options as applicable

1.  The code will run perfectly.

2.  Compilation error. p = {3, 7}; is not the correct way to initialize a structure variable in C.

3.  Compilation error. `p` variable name is too short for structures. It needs to be at least 2 character length.




Answer: 1.  The code will run perfectly.
