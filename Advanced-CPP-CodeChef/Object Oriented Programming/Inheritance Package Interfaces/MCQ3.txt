How is ambiguity resolved in C++ when a derived class inherits from multiple base classes with the same member function names? Select the correct option.

1.  The compiler automatically selects one of the base class functions.

2.  The programmer must explicitly specify which base class function to use using scope resolution.

3.  Ambiguity cannot be resolved; it results in a compilation error.

4.  The base class functions are renamed in the derived class.




Answer: 2.  The programmer must explicitly specify which base class function to use using scope resolution.
