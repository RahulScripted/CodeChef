// N candidates (numbered from 1 to N) join Chef's firm. The first 5 candidates join on the first day, and then, on every subsequent day, the next 5 candidates join in. Candidate numbered K (K â‰¤ N) decided to turn down his offer and thus, Chef adjusts the position by shifting up all the higher numbered candidates. This leads to a change in the joining day of some of the candidates. Help Chef determine the number of candidates who will join on a different day than expected.
