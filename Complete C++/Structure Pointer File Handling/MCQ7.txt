What is wrong in the code given here?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *ptr;

    // Allocate memory for an integer
    ptr = new int;

    cout << "Value = " << *ptr;

    delete ptr;
    return 0;
}


Select the correct option.

1.  Nothing - seems perfect.

2.  Accessing uninitialized memory can result in garbage values or crashes. We need to initialize the allocated memory before accessing it.

3.  Not freeing allocated memory can lead to memory leaks. Always free allocated memory before the program exits.





Answer: 2.  Accessing uninitialized memory can result in garbage values or crashes. We need to initialize the allocated memory before accessing it.
