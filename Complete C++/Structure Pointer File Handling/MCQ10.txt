The following code is trying to read strings / characters from a file.
Which of the following statements are true about this program?

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    string fileName = "input.txt";
    ifstream inputFile(fileName);
    
    string buffer;
    while (getline(inputFile, buffer)) {
        cout << buffer << "\n";
    }
    
    inputFile.close();
    return 0;
}




Select multiple options as applicable.

1.  The getline function takes all the strings line by line including  the space character.

2.  The getline function takes all the strings excluding the space character and the new line character.

3.  This declares a input stream to the file input.txt

4.  ifstream inputFile(fileName) opens the file in write stream.
