What is wrong in the code given here?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *ptr;

    // Allocate memory for an integer
    ptr = new int;
    *ptr = 0;
     
    delete ptr;

    cout << "Value = " << *ptr;
    return 0;

Select the correct option.

1.  Nothing - seems perfect.

2.  Not freeing allocated memory can lead to memory leaks. Always free allocated memory before the program exits.

3.  Accessing freed memory can result in garbage values or crashes.
