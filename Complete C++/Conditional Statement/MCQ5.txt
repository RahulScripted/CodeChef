What will be the output of this code?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  int b = -10;

  if (a >= b)
  {
     printf("a is greater or equal to b. ");
  }
  if (a == 0 || b == 0){
     cout << "At least one is 0. ";
  }
  if (a == 0 && b == 0){
     cout << "Both are 0. ";
  }
  cout << "Program ends");
  return 0;
}
